# CS571 - Mobile Application Development
## Final Project 
**This is an individual project.**
### Application specifications and requirements
You will create a mobile application to help users find assistance from volunteers during the time of the novel covid-19 pandemic.  
  
Your app should be able to track the user's location and display a map for volunteers who offer their time to help other people in need.  
  
Users should be able to switch their volunteering state (true/false) easily. Your app will only show those who have their volunteering state set to 'true'.  
  
After searching for the nearest volunteers, the app will allow users to communicate via SMS, an SMS will be sent from the user needing the service with a message to the volunteer.
  
Your project must include the following:
* Implement a login based system using JSON Web Token (JWT).
* Use UI Kit.
* Use Expo SDK APIs.
* Use Express/MongoDB for supportive backend API. All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes). Persist the app state in AsyncStorage.  
  
**Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.**.   
  
Project will be evaluated based on your code quality (not quantity). I may need to schedule meetings with some students to discuss their code-source.  

## Submission Requirements:
Please make sure you submit following requirements:  
* You are required to submit a detailed project plan for your daily performance (day/task/time) and submit it with your code.
* You are required to submit a documentation file with full details about your backend API and frontend mobile app design structure.   

**Deadline is Monday, May 11th, 08:00 PM** 
  
**Good luck and happy coding!**
